# Alarm-Clock
This project implements a fully functional digital alarm clock using Verilog and Vivado. The design includes features such as setting the time, alarm functionality, and real-time clock display. The project simulates clock timing and alarm triggers, with testbenches for verifying accuracy and reliability on FPGA.
